Description: Semi-parametric estimation problem can be solved by two-step Newton-Raphson iteration. The implicit profiling method<arXiv:2108.07928> is an improved method of two-step NR iteration especially for the implicit-bundled type of the parametric part and non-parametric part. This package provides a function semislv() supporting the above two methods and numeric derivative approximation for unprovided Jacobian matrix.
