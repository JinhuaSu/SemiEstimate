Description: Semi-parametric estimation problem can be solved by two-step Newton-Raphson iteration. The implicit Profiling method(our arXiv paper with the title of "Implicit Profiling Estimation for Semiparametric Models with Bundled Parameters" will be released before 2021.9.1) is an improved method of two-step NR iteration especially for the implicit-bundled type of the parametric part and non-parametric part. This package provides a function semislv() supporting the above two methods and numeric derivative approximation for unprovided Jacobian matrix.
